# JavaScript and classes 
Yes, JavaScript does have classes, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and it's classes are just syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based such as java or C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.

## OOP

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase 

## why use OOP
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript offers a more structured and organized way to manage complex code. It encourages the use of reusable objects, making the code easier to debug and maintain. With OOP, we can build more scalable applications by creating modules that can be easily extended without modifying existing code. Plus, it aligns well with other modern development practices and frameworks, which makes collaboration smoother if you're working in a team.
